# Data-Warehousing-Fall-2017
This repository contains the final project for the Data Warehousing class in 2017



NYPD Crime Analysis: Data Warehousing Project

For the final Data Warehousing project, my team and I applied all the concepts learned in class to create a mini Data Warehouse with a data set of our choosing.

We decided to analyze a subset of crimes including Burglary, Robbery, Vehicle and Traffic Laws reported to the New York Police Department for the year 2017.

Once the final data set was selected, we needed to:

•	Create a Trello board to track the progress of the project and responsibility of each team member

•	Create a conceptual model of the data using Lucid Chart 

•	Analyze the data quality using MS - Excel

•	Create a data quality scorecard

•	Cleanse the data as needed

•	Create a dimensional model of the data using MySQL Workbench

•	Create database tables to match the dimensional model using MySQL Workbench

•	Load the data into the dimensional model tables using the Talend’s ETL tool: Talend Open Studio for Data Integration

•	Connect database tables to Tableau

•	Create visualizations to showcase the data
